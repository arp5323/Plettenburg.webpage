		<h1>Elephant Sanctuary</h1>
		<p class = "pp">
		The home of twelve African Elephants which have been domesticated and provide the tourists with an amazing opportunity to watch them in their natural environment.  The park/reserve was established in 1999.  The African Elephants roamed this area in large herds until the 1900's when farmers and hunters led to their near extinction. Only thirty miles away deep in the Knysna forest you can still find the African Elephant in their natural habitat.
