		When the screen size changes to 350px the navigation bar that is normally displayed horizontally is displayed vertically and moved to the top left corner. The main picture of the page has a lighter section of the picture in the sky and from the sunlight that is why I choose the title position. 
		
		The temp.shtml file works through SSI commands to display a templete like structure that contains the main picture, navigation and social media links. This section of the page is included on every page that uses the SSI command
		<br><br>
		A simple and fun feature that I added is when the user navigates onto the title of the page it disapears to allow full view of the image.
		I choose a simple pale blue/grey color scheme which makes the page enjoyble to look at for a long period of time. The color scheme also relates to the place itself. The town has many beaches and is well known for surfing. The pictures throughout the website are placed in different locations depending on the content, this gives the website a less repetetive appearance.

		Parts that I could have been improved on would be edditing image size on photoshop therefore using less css. I would like to have spent more time reducing the amount of css used.
